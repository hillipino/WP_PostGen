wpPostGen (https://github.com/hillipino/WP_PostGen) is a WordPress Plugin that will take a
csv file (e.g. affiliate feeds) and turn it into published / scheduled posts.

== Description ==

wpPostGen is a WordPress Plugin that will take a csv file (e.g. affiliate feeds) 
and turn it into published / scheduled posts. It provides a powerful yet
flexible user-interface for defining WordPress column relationships as well as
real-time manipulation of data while the importing process is taking place. See
below for a full list of features...

Features:

* jQuery / AJAX / PHP / MySQL technologies to provide an enhanced user-interface
  and multi-stage import procedure that greatly reduces PHP script execution
  timeouts from occurring when dealing with large files.
  
* Randomize imported lines prior to creating your WordPress Posts. This allows
  Random generation of your Posts if desired.
  
* Supports pipe, comma, tab and semicolon delimited CSV files.

* Ideal for YouTube-like sites or other syndicated content solutions that need
  to import feeds into WordPress from a downloaded CSV file.
  
* Generates posts from a user-defined start date.
  (defaults to your latest post date)

* Assign labels to your imports so you can easily identify them at a later time
  and remove if necessary.
  
* Powerful and flexible Data Mapping which allows users to define relationships
  that easily point the imported data to the right WordPress columns in the db.
  
* Allows user to generate posts using a set interval of months, weeks, days,
  hours, and minutes.

* Allows user to specify how many posts per interval of days specified.

* Utilizes Media Library to store your CSV file so you can keep all of your
  uploaded WordPress files in one area.
  
* Supports generating regular posts as well as pages and other custom post types.

* Allows custom defined "theme" mappings. This provides a simple way to always
  ensure the right data mappings are setup for popular WordPress Themes.

* Also allows existing import data mappings as well so you can choose the same
  data mappings you have defined in previous imports.
  
* Wrap column data during import by specifying before / after text that will
  prepend / append for each post.

* Select pre-defined widgets that support FLV Player Embed HTML as well as
  IMG tags. This is idea for column data that provides an image url or flv link
  and you wish to embed these into your posts for the user to display when not
  supported by a WordPress theme.

* Create Word / Phrase Replacement Lists that contain Keywords / Phrases that
  will be replaced with Keywords / Phrases of your choosing.
  
* Automatic category generation for posts when included as column in the import
  file (uses single word or comma separated list of categories).

* Automatic tag generation for posts using part-of-speech tagging to ensure
  more relevant words are used.

* Specify whether a column's data is required. This will skip lines / rows in
  your import so they will not generate malformed posts.
  
* Leave column relationships blank to skip / ignore that column's data from
  being imported.
  
* Keeps track of the posts generated during an import so if any errors are
  encountered or you are unhappy with how the data was imported, you can easily
  remove all posts related to that specific import.
